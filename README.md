This project aims at determining if a patient is suffering from Pneumonia based on images of Chest X-Rays. We use the three-layered Convolutional Neural Network to determine if the patient is facing Pneumonia of any kind.

Currently working on implementing more layers to further classify the type of Pneumonia the patient is suffering from and the stage that the user is currently in.
